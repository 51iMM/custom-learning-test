## Prerequisites

- You will need to be a tenant administrator to be able to deploy this solution to the target tenant.
Note that you can get free developer tenant from [Office 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev-program), if needed
- Automatic end-to-end provisioning only works with English tenants. All solutions and web parts are also English in the current implementation
- A tenant `App Catalog` must have been created within the `Apps` option of the SharePoint Admin Center. Please see [Set up your Office 365 tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-developer-tenant#create-app-catalog-site) and follow the Create app catalog site section. If your tenant-wide App Catalog has already been provisioned, you will need access to an account that has rights to upload a package to it to complete this setup process. Generally, this is an account with the SharePoint administrator role. If an account with that role does not work, go to the SharePoint admin center and find the Site Collection Administrators for the app catalog site collection and either log in as one of the Site Collection Administrators, or add the SharePoint administrator account that failed to the Site Collection Administrators. You will also need access to an account that is a SharePoint Tenant Admin.
